# cohort-analysis
Cohort analysis involves dividing users into distinct groups, or cohorts, based on certain criteria. In this case study, these cohorts are defined by the time of user acquisition. By grouping users together based on time of acquisition, we can study how different cohorts behave in terms of engagement and retention.

For example, you might create cohorts based on the month users first signed up for your service. You can then track how each cohort's activity, such as their conversion rate or lifetime value, evolves over time. This approach allows you to identify trends, anomalies, and areas where you may need to make adjustments to improve user retention and satisfaction.

# Retention Rate Time-Based Cohort Analysis:

Retention rate time-based cohort analysis is a specialized form of cohort analysis that focuses on the retention of users over multiple time periods.

To perform retention rate time-based cohort analysis, you would typically:

Create cohorts based on user acquisition dates.

Measure the percentage of users from each cohort who continue to engage with your product or service over time (e.g., after 1 month, 3 months, etc.).

Analyze how retention rates vary across different cohorts and time periods, enabling you to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

This analysis can reveal whether certain cohorts have better or worse retention rates, helping the business understand the factors contributing to user retention or attrition. It can also assist in optimizing marketing, product development, and customer support strategies.
